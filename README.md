# ComfyUI Custom Node Tutorial

This repo contains the code examples from my YouTube tutorial on creating custom nodes in ComfyUI with Python.

## Tutorial Video

You can find the full tutorial video here: [link to YouTube video](https://youtu.be/RSp9_fh3JoI)

I walk through:

- Understanding how ComfyUI loads and interprets custom nodes
- Breaking down the built-in example node
- Building a custom node from scratch to combine positive and negative prompt encoders
- Defining node inputs, outputs, and processing functions
- Connecting the node to ConfiUI and sampling images

## Contents

This repo contains:

- example_node.py: The default ComfyUI example node code
- example2.py: The custom node code I create in the tutorial video
- readme.md: This getting started guide

## Getting Started

To test out the custom node code yourself:

- Download this repo
- Install ComfyUI and the required packages
- Place example2.py in your ComfyUI custom nodes folder
- Start ComfyUI to automatically import the node
- Add the node in the UI from the `Example2` category and connect inputs/outputs
- Refer to the video for more detailed steps on loading and using the custom node.

Let me know if you have any other questions!
